    <p class="about">Soham Suvarna is a high-school student and also a developer. He is interested in all things about
      Robots, Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning. Robots can be fascinating, and he found out about this when
      he tried building his first robot in early 2019. Later on, he went forward to work on various projects like
      Discord Bots, Websites, Applications, Libraries, and more. Apart from this, he is also a huge fan of the game
      Detroit: Become Human and can often be found putting in random references related to it.</p>
